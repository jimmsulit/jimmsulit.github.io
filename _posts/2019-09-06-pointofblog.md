When I started learning data science, I tried my best to keep my progress to myself. You could say that I bought into the idea that I should make progress in silence. No reason for me to tell the world that I am doing what I was doing. Besides, there is StackOverflow, Quora, and Reddit whenever I need a helping hand on the projects that I am working on.

It was alright for the first few months but when you are just copying and pasting bits of code from various sources, it comes to a point when it just becomes a routine. This impacts your understanding as it either regresses or gets forgotten over time. Progress in silence took the back seat when I realized that casually sharing the things that I have learned to my friends during our scheduled catchups helped me retain and fully understand the new concepts that I have been exposed to. 


Of course, it is not going to be every day that I will have the resources or energy to meet my friends so I had to think of a way to make this self-process a regular part of my life. I figured that it has to be an activity that I am quite good at and comfortable at doing regularly. This is where it all clicked. I have been doing my end-of-day reviews for quite some time and that is where writing about my learnings in a blog came into mind.  


As a self-taught data scientist, I was fortunate enough to cover the minimum set of skills required to break into the field. Moreover, I was able to spend a reasonable amount of time to practice mock-interviews with friends and in front of the mirror. These two factors helped me land a data science job in a good tech company. Fast forward to almost six months on the job, I was able to identify the skills that I have to address to keep improving as a data scientist. This and the fact that data science is an ever-growing field - if you do not employ a growth mindset and embrace life-long learning you will be left behind. 


I realized that writing a blog to document my learning is an example of the application of the Feynman technique. This mental model developed by the physicist Richard Feynman details that in order for you to truly master a subject, you need to be able to explain it back to somebody in simple terms. My goal with this data blog is to write about the things that I am learning and relearning in such a way that I am just talking to a friend who is genuinely curious about what I am doing. This way, I will be able to consolidate my understanding by explaining it back to the readers. Writing a blog post will help me fully understand the concepts that I am learning.  


The benefit does not end there. I found that one issue with being a self-taught data scientist is that there is less opportunity to get feedback, especially when you do not put yourself out there. Feedback is an important element in fully understanding new concepts and the internet is a great feedback network. Say you are writing about the application of a particular machine learning algorithm, if there are mistakes on the code or how things are explained, there is a chance that someone will leave a comment on your blog to clear that out. In addition to that, committing these mistakes on self-led projects can help you prevent similar issues from transpiring in a workplace scenario. 


Lastly, writing a blog is a good way of connecting with like-minded individuals who are learning the same thing or those who are already working in the field of data science. I found out that establishing such connections not only boost your learning but it also helps you gain access to career-advancing opportunities or potential projects where you could have an impact on people's lives.
