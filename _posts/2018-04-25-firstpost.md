Whenever I do work, I want everything to be perfect. I make sure that I have both the knowledge and best tools related to the topic. Through many attempts, I saw that this kind of thinking leads to analysis paralysis. Nothing gets done. Focusing more on thinking takes your mind away from what is more important - doing. Joining this challenge has made me realize that while the journey might be messy, learning and improving along the way is a surprising benefit.  


Truth be told, I joined the challenge with little preparation. That is why even on my 77th day, I reckon that my system could still be efficiently improved. Despite numerous points for improvement, taking notes of my mistakes and addressing them as I go along made me more hopeful for the future. Moreover, it made me realize that the challenge is building something in me that is key to my future success: inner resilience and exposure to computational thinking.  For the remaining days of the challenge, I decided to devote the time to refine my thought process and productivity systems. Balancing my learning and a full-time day job (plus long hours of commute) is difficult but definitely achievable.  


Furthermore, to put emphasis on my learning, I will try my best to make blogging an essential part of my data analysis and coding journey. I do not know the full extent of the benefits of this activity but I am sure that this process will prevent me from indulging myself in shallow or lousy learning. And Netflix? Well, thanks to the app SelfControl because it helped me set an environment free from potential distractions.
