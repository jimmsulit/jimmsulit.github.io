Hey, I'm Jim.

I'm a data scientist and multifaceted problem solver with experience in building web and mobile products in fast-growing companies in the Philippines. I'm passionate about bridging the digital divide and providing people with information on how they can use technology to make their lives better.

I'm currently at IBM Philippines working on the global data of the finance and operations teams, helping them identify strategies to streamline funnels and processes. Before that, I was at Globe Telecom and Computer Professionals Inc. as a systems analyst. 

You'll find my work, personal and professional interests here. If you are interested in discussing data or collaborating professionally, you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimsonsulit/)


**About the Blog**

This blog is an account of my quest as a data scientist. Achieving my goal of getting comfortable with research and analysis by becoming a data scientist is just the first step in my journey. I still have a lot to learn and I will do so by getting my hands dirty with data and numbers to try and find useful insights that can shed light on problems in business, politics, and society.
