I am a millennial currently employed as a Systems/Data Analyst in the biggest Telco in the Philippines. I design and test solutions needed to implement robust systems that will address system optimization challenges and architectural requirement needs. With my exposure to data at work, I got introduced to the field of data science and decided to take my data knowledge to the next level.
